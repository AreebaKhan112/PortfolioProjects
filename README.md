##COVID Data Analysis using SQL
_____________________________________________________________________________
Used SQL to analyze COVID deads and COVID vaccines datasets and answer questions like:
      - What percentage of people who got COVID ended up dying?
      - What is the likelihood of dying if you were in Canada?
      - What percentage of people in Canada were affected?
      - What were the countries with highest infection rate?
      - What were the countries with the highest death count?
      etc

Created CTEs and joins to anayze how many people got vaccinated.

Created temp tables to analyze what percentage of people got the vaccine.

Created views to store data for later visualizations.

Created a dashboard on Tableau for visualization :
